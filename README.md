### Description
These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).

### Building
To build from source, Rust is integrated with the `cargo` build system. To install Rust and `cargo`, just follow [these instructions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html). Once installed, while in the project directory, execute this command to run the solution `cargo run -p day1 --release` (replayce `day1` with whichever solution you want to see).
